# Markdown Previewer

## Objective

Develop a Markdown previewer where users can input Markdown text and instantly see the rendered HTML output.

## Key Features

- **Markdown Input**: Provide a text area where users can type or paste Markdown content.
- **Live Preview**: Display the HTML-rendered output in real-time as users type or update the Markdown content.
- **Customization**: Allow users to customize the editor with options such as choosing a different theme or adjusting font size.
- **Export**: Enable users to download the rendered HTML content as a file.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: To enhance readability, implement syntax highlighting for the Markdown input area. (Optional).

## Technologies
